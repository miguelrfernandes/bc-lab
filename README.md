Computational Biology Labs 2022-2023
===============================
This repository contains the work I did for the Labs of the Computational Biology course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, during the 2022-2023 academic year.

The course is divided into 6 Labs, each one with a different topic. The Labs are:

<ol>
<li>Biological Databases</li>
<li>Sequence Alignment</li>
<li>Probabilistic Models</li>
<li>Biomedical Statistical Learning</li>
<li>GWAS tutorial</li>
<li>Omics Applications</li>
</ol>

Each Lab has its folder, with a README.md file containing some information about the Lab and the work done, and the code used to solve the exercises.

The Labs are done in Python. 
The Labs are done in groups of 4 students.
