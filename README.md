Computational Biology Labs 2022-2023
===============================
This repository contains the work I did for the Labs of the Computational Biology course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, during the 2022-2023 academic year.

The course is divided into 6 Labs, each one with a different topic. The Labs are:

Lab 1: Biological Databases
Lab 2: Sequence Alignment
Lab 3: Probabilistic Models
Lab 4: Biomedical Statistical Learning
Lab 5: GWAS tutorial
Lab 6: Omics Applications

Each Lab has its folder, with a README.md file containing some information about the Lab and the work done, and the code used to solve the exercises.
